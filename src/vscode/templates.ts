**IMPORTANT**: Follow these exact steps:
1. Create and write your complete response to: {{responseFileTmp}}
2. When completely finished, run these PowerShell commands to signal completion:
\`\`\`
Move-Item -LiteralPath '{{responseFileTmp}}' -Destination '{{responseFileFinal}}'
if (Test-Path subagent.lock) { del subagent.lock }
\`\`\`

Do not proceed to step 2 until your response is completely written to the temporary file.

**IMPORTANT**: Follow these exact steps:
1. Create and write your complete response to: {{responseFileTmp}}
2. When completely finished and the response is stable, rename it to: {{responseFileFinal}}
3. Do not unlock the workspace from this request; batch orchestration will handle unlocking after all responses are ready.
